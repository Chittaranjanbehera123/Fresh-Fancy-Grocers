<h1 align="center">Delitaly - Django e-commerce</h1>

[View the live project here.](https://delitaly.herokuapp.com)

Delitaly is a project in Python / Django Framework that I created a few years ago as final exam for a course in Full Stack Development. Delitaly is basically an e-commerce written from scratch. This project uses the following Django Apps: “Allauth” for users subscriptions, access and management, “Profiles” for users’ info and purchase history, “Products” for the shop and items management (search, add, edit, delete),  “Checkout” for the payment screen. I used Amazon Web Services for the deployment of static files such as CSS and Media files. I integrated Stripe for online payment processing. 

In this last year (2022), I successfully completed a further course in UX Design, then by looking at this project I realise that now, with more experience in both software development and ux design, I would definitely write a better CSS and choose a better style. But that is the nice part when you improve and look back at what you have done, you understand what it took to become skilled. The code in Django is pretty fine, I would only extend it for further or more complete features.
